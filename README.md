# UTSA-MSDA-Customer-Retention-Case-Study

# Background.

Managing customer retention and acquisition is essential for developing and
maintaining customer relationships. The first step to cure customer retention
and acquisition is to predict which customers have a high probability of ending
their relationship with the firm and the probability of acquiring a new customer.
The second step is to target the predicted at-risk current customers or new
customers with high likelihood of joining using incentives such as pricing offers
or communications such as emails. Models that accurately predict customer
retention and acquisition are pivotal in targeting the right customers, thereby
decreasing the cost of the marketing campaign and using scarce firm resources
more efficiently.

# Data:
To access the data in R: load the SMCRM package and execute
data(acquisitionRetention).
Therefore, in this case-study, please address the following tasks and write the
report using the Case-study guidelines.

# Tasks:
• Use acquisitionRetention data set to predict which customers will be
acquired and for how long (duration) based on a feature set using a random
forest.

• Compute variable importance to detect interactions and optimize hyper-
parameters for acquired customers.

• Compare the accuracy of model with a decision trees and logistic regression
model for acquiring customers.
